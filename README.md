### Project Title
Bikeshare Project

### Description
This project includes a python script that reads bikeshare data for 3 different cities in the US.  These cities are Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

The script asks the user which city they would like to see data for and will then perform and display various
statistical calculations based on the data from the relative .csv file.

After this data is displayed, the script will ask the user if he/she wants to view the raw data.  If an
affirmative response is received, the script will display 5 lines of raw data.

The script will then enter a loop and ask the user if they want to see additional raw data.  If an affirmative response is received, the script will display another 5 lines of raw data.  This loop continues until the user
inputs data that he/she doesn't want to view any more raw data.
